# VS6: Polish & Scale

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Goal**: Production-ready build with performance optimization, UI/UX polish, and stability

## Deliverables

### 1. Network Optimization
- [ ] Implement binary protocol (packages/protocol/src/binaryEncoder.ts)
  - Component bitmasks for delta updates
  - Varint encoding for positions (int16, precision 0.01m)
  - Shared entity schema dictionary
  - Target: 50-70% bandwidth reduction vs. JSON
- [ ] Enhanced interest management: Dynamic update frequency based on priority
  - Critical (own player): 30hz
  - High (nearby players/worms): 20hz
  - Medium (distant entities): 10hz
  - Low (static objects): 5hz
- [ ] Server-side delta compression: Only send changed components
- [ ] Client-side input batching: Send multiple inputs in single packet when high-frequency

**Tests**: Bandwidth <20 kbps/player, server tick stable at 30hz with 50 players

### 2. Rendering Optimization
- [ ] GPU instancing for all repeated objects (rocks, plants, etc.)
- [ ] Frustum culling with bounding sphere checks
- [ ] Occlusion culling for Sietch interior
- [ ] LOD system refinement: 3-4 levels per asset type
- [ ] Texture atlasing: Combine small textures into single atlas
- [ ] Shader optimization: Reduce fragment shader complexity
- [ ] Target: Consistent 60fps on GTX 1060 with 20 visible entities

**Tests**: FPS never drops below 55 on target hardware, draw calls <500

### 3. Memory Management
- [ ] Object pooling for bullets, particles, temporary effects
- [ ] Terrain chunk unloading: Remove chunks >500m from all players
- [ ] Texture compression: Use KTX2 format with Basis Universal
- [ ] Asset streaming: Load high-detail models only when needed
- [ ] Memory budget: <2GB VRAM, <1GB RAM on client

**Tests**: Memory usage stable over 2-hour session, no leaks detected

### 4. UI/UX Overhaul (Dune Aesthetic)
- [ ] Apply design system from old docs:
  - Fonts: Chakra Petch (headers), Roboto (body)
  - Colors: Deep blue (#1A3A6E), Spice orange (#D9730D), Sand beige (#E5DED1)
  - Angular containers with 30° corners
  - 8px grid system for spacing
- [ ] HUD redesign: Minimalist, opacity options (0-100%)
- [ ] Menus: Main, Pause, Settings, Inventory, Squad, Clan
- [ ] Accessibility: Text size (S/M/L), colorblind modes (3 types), high contrast
- [ ] Keybinding: Full remapping support, gamepad support
- [ ] Tutorial refinement: Interactive prompts, skip option

**Tests**: All UI readable at 1080p and 4K, accessibility modes functional

### 5. Audio System
- [ ] Positional 3D audio: Worm rumbles, gunfire, footsteps
- [ ] Dynamic music: Intensity increases during combat, calm during exploration
- [ ] Voice lines: Character barks (enemy spotted, low water, etc.)
- [ ] Audio settings: Master, Music, SFX, Voice volumes, spatial audio toggle
- [ ] Optimization: Audio pooling, max 32 concurrent sounds

**Tests**: Audio spatialization accurate, no popping/crackling, performance impact <5%

### 6. Server Infrastructure
- [ ] Railway deployment optimization:
  - Multi-region: NA East, NA West, EU West, Asia Pacific
  - Auto-scaling: 1-10 instances per region based on load
  - Health checks: `/health` endpoint, auto-restart on failure
  - Monitoring: CPU, memory, bandwidth, tick rate, player count
- [ ] Database optimization:
  - Connection pooling (min 5, max 20)
  - Indexes on all foreign keys
  - Query optimization (use EXPLAIN for slow queries)
  - Automated daily backups
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline:
  - GitHub Actions: Lint, test, build on PR
  - Auto-deploy to staging on merge to `develop`
  - Manual approval for production deployment
  - Rollback script ready

**Tests**: Deploy completes in <5 minutes, health checks pass, rollback works

### 7. Matchmaking & Rooms
- [ ] Queue optimizations: Reduce wait time <30s average
- [ ] Room backfill: Add new players to in-progress matches (join mid-game)
- [ ] Server browser: List public rooms, join directly, custom room names
- [ ] Private matches: Password-protected, custom settings (time limit, difficulty)
- [ ] Reconnect handling: Rejoin same room if disconnected <5 minutes

**Tests**: Matchmaking <30s, reconnect works >95% of time

### 8. Anti-Cheat & Security
- [ ] Server-side validation:
  - Movement: Max speed, teleport detection, clipping detection
  - Combat: Hit angle validation, impossible shots rejected
  - Resources: Transaction logs, idempotency keys, rate limits
- [ ] Client integrity:
  - Basic obfuscation (not critical for MVP)
  - Token rotation (JWT refresh after 1 hour)
  - IP-based rate limiting (max 10 requests/second)
- [ ] Reporting system: Players can report cheaters, auto-flag suspicious activity

**Tests**: Speed hacks detected, invalid hits rejected, resource duplication prevented

### 9. Analytics & Telemetry
- [ ] Server metrics: Player count, match duration, objective completion rate
- [ ] Client metrics: FPS, crash rate, error logs
- [ ] Gameplay metrics: Popular roles, average match time, progression speed
- [ ] Privacy: Opt-in telemetry, anonymized data, GDPR-compliant
- [ ] Dashboard: Simple web dashboard showing key metrics (internal use)

**Tests**: Metrics collected correctly, no PII leaked, dashboard displays live data

### 10. Testing & QA
- [ ] Unit tests: >80% coverage for core systems
- [ ] Integration tests: Key flows (connect, play match, disconnect)
- [ ] Load testing: Simulate 100 concurrent players per region
- [ ] Stress testing: Extreme conditions (1000 entities, packet loss, high latency)
- [ ] Soak testing: 24-hour run to detect memory leaks
- [ ] Cross-platform: Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Bug bash: Internal team plays for 1 week, log all issues

**Tests**: <10 critical bugs, <50 minor bugs, no P0 blockers

### 11. Community Features
- [ ] Friend system: Add/remove friends, see online status
- [ ] Social hub: Sietch area where players can gather (no combat)
- [ ] Emote wheel: 12 emotes (unlockable via progression)
- [ ] Cosmetics: Character skins, worm skins (purchased with spice)
- [ ] Leaderboards: Top players by spice earned, objectives completed
- [ ] Patch notes: In-game display of recent changes

**Tests**: Friends list syncs, cosmetics display correctly, leaderboards accurate

### 12. Launch Preparation
- [ ] Press kit: Screenshots, trailer, fact sheet
- [ ] Landing page: Overview, sign-up for beta
- [ ] Community channels: Discord server, subreddit, Twitter
- [ ] Closed beta: 50-100 invited players, gather feedback
