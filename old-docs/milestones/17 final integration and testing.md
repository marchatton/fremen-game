# Milestone 17: Final Integration and Testing

## Overview
Ensure all systems (M1-M16) work together seamlessly. Conduct thorough end-to-end testing, fix critical bugs, perform final balancing, and prepare the polished build for launch.

## Requirements

### 17.1 System Integration
- Final Pass: Test all cross-milestone interactions (e.g., Missions using Combat/Resources, Weather affecting Stealth, UI reflecting all states). Ensure consistent event handling and error logging.
- Network Protocol Freeze: Finalize and document the complete network message protocol. Implement version checking.
- Deployment Pipeline: Ensure automated build process (M16 CI/CD) produces client/server builds reliably. Create staging environment mirroring production.

### 17.2 Comprehensive Testing
- Automated Tests: Aim for target unit test coverage (~80%) for critical logic. Implement key integration tests (player connect -> move -> interact -> complete mission). Run tests in CI pipeline.
- Manual Testing: Develop structured test plan covering all features, edge cases, platforms. Conduct focused playtesting sessions. Use bug tracking system rigorously.
- Load Testing (Basic): Use simple scripts to simulate concurrent users (e.g., 50-100) on Railway staging. Monitor server resources/response times. Identify basic bottlenecks.
- Network Simulation: Test gameplay under simulated latency (50-300ms) and packet loss (1-5%). Verify prediction/reconciliation handles conditions gracefully.

### 17.3 Bug Fixing and Optimization
- Prioritization: Focus on fixing crashes, progression blockers, major gameplay bugs, critical security vulnerabilities. Use severity/priority levels.
- Verification & Regression: Ensure fixes are verified. Add regression tests (automated or manual steps).
- Performance Polish: Address remaining performance bottlenecks. Optimize critical code paths based on profiling. Ensure memory usage is stable. Target consistent 60fps on mid-spec.

### 17.4 Balancing and Tuning
- Gameplay: Review and adjust core parameters: player movement, health/damage, resource costs/gains, AI difficulty, mission rewards. Aim for challenging but fair experience.
- Economy: Ensure resource sinks balance faucets. Check crafting costs (if any) vs. utility. Verify trade values (M13).
- Multiplayer: Check balance for different team sizes. Ensure cooperative mechanics feel rewarding.
- Data Driven: Use playtest feedback to inform balancing decisions. Iterate.

### 17.5 Launch Preparation
- Builds: Create final Release Candidate builds for client/server.
- Checklists: Prepare deployment checklists for Vercel and Railway.
- Documentation: Finalize minimal player-facing documentation. Update internal technical documentation.
- Monitoring Plan: Ensure server monitoring/alerting (M16) is active.
- Rollback Plan: Document basic rollback procedure.

## Deliverables
- Fully integrated game with all systems functioning together.
- Comprehensive test results (automated, manual, load, network sim).
- Fixed critical and high-priority bugs with verification.
- Balanced gameplay with final tuning adjustments based on testing.
- Finalized deployment pipeline for Vercel and Railway.
- Launch-ready Release Candidate build.
- Basic player documentation.
- Post-launch monitoring plan.

## Testing and Validation
- Game runs at target frame rate (60fps) on recommended specifications.
- Server handles expected concurrent player load (e.g., 50-100 users) with high uptime on Railway.
- All critical gameplay paths function without blocking issues.
- Network play is stable with varying connection quality.
- Loading times meet target metrics (initial: <30s, chunk loads: seamless).
- Automated tests pass reliably in CI.
- Memory usage remains stable during extended play sessions.
- Final build passes manual test plan.
