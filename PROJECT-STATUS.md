# Fremen Game - Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Phase**: VS2 - Worm Riding Core (73% complete)

## Quick Stats

- **Total Commits**: 20+
- **Test Coverage**: 52 tests (45 server, 7 shared) - 100% passing ✅
- **Build Status**: All packages compile ✅
- **Playable**: Yes - core worm riding loop functional ✅

## Milestone Progress

### ✅ VS1: Online Sandbox (100% Complete)
- Multiplayer networking with JWT auth
- Procedural terrain with chunking
- Player movement with client prediction
- Sandworm patrol AI
- Thumper deployment and attraction
- Chat system
- Smooth movement (Y-axis prediction fix)

**Duration**: ~1 day actual (2-4 weeks estimated)

### 🚧 VS2: Worm Riding Core (73% Complete)

**Completed (8/11)**:
1. ✅ Worm Mounting System
2. ✅ Worm Steering Controls
3. ✅ Advanced Worm Animation (undulation, head tracking)
4. ✅ Dismounting System
5. ✅ Worm Health & Danger (terrain damage)
6. ✅ Shepherd Objective (3min timer, visual marker)
7. ✅ Third-Person Camera (riding mode, FOV)
8. ✅ UI/UX Polish (HUD, prompts, markers)

**Remaining (3/11)** - Optional Polish:
- ⏳ Character Animations (rigging, walk/ride cycles)
- ⏳ Enhanced Prediction (worm-specific reconciliation)
- ⏳ Tutorial Flow (5-step guided experience)

**Core Loop**: Deploy thumper → Mount worm → Steer to objective → Complete/Dismount

**Duration**: ~1 day actual for core (4-6 weeks estimated for full polish)

### 📋 VS3: Resource Loop (Not Started)
- Spice harvesting
- Water survival
- Persistence (DrizzleORM + PostgreSQL)

### 📋 VS4: PvE Combat (Not Started)
- Harkonnen patrols
- Combat system
- Thumper jamming

### 📋 VS5: Squad Cooperation (Not Started)
- Role specialization
- Team objectives

### 📋 VS6: Polish & Scale (Not Started)
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinement
- Stability improvements

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- ✅ Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode across all packages
- ✅ ESLint + shared configs
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI (lint + typecheck)

### Networking
- ✅ Socket.io with JWT auth
- ✅ Client prediction/reconciliation (200ms buffer)
- ✅ Server-authoritative state (30hz tick)
- ✅ Smooth Y-axis terrain following
- ✅ State sync with lastProcessedInputSeq

### Game Systems
- ✅ Terrain: Simplex noise, chunk-based, LOD
- ✅ Worm AI: 4 states (patrol, approach, ridden, spiral)
- ✅ Physics: Server validation, anti-cheat
- ✅ Objectives: Timer, radius detection, auto-spawn
- ✅ Damage: Terrain collision, health tracking

### Performance
- ✅ 60fps client rendering
- ✅ 30hz server tick rate
- ✅ <30 kbps/player bandwidth
- ✅ <150ms perceived input lag

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development (server + client)
pnpm run dev

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build for production
pnpm run build
```

**URLs**:
- Client: http://localhost:5173
- Server: http://localhost:3000

## Controls

### On Foot
- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **E** - Deploy thumper
- **C** - Toggle debug camera
- **Enter** - Chat

### While Riding Worm
- **WASD** - Steer worm (A/D heading, W/S speed)
- **E** - Dismount
- **Mouse** - Look around
- Watch HUD for speed and health

## Next Steps

1. **Playtest VS2** - Validate fun factor (target: 7+/10)
2. **Iterate on feel** - Adjust turn rate, camera, speed based on feedback
3. **Decision**: Add VS2 polish OR move to VS3
4. **VS3 Planning** - Resource loop (spice, water, persistence)

## Known Issues

- E key context-sensitive (might need separate keys)
- Worm may take damage from minor bumps
- Camera may clip terrain in steep areas
- No worm respawn after death yet
- No invulnerability after dismount

## Success Metrics

**Met**:
- ✅ Core loop playable end-to-end
- ✅ 60fps performance
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Smooth movement

**To Validate**:
- ❓ Fun factor (playtester feedback)
- ❓ 7+/10 rating for worm riding
- ❓ Players want "one more round"

---

**Conclusion**: VS1 fully complete, VS2 core gameplay complete and playable. Ready for playtesting to validate fun factor before adding polish or moving to VS3.
