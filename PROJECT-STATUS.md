- Full kill tracking (players can kill Harkonnen)

**Outpost Features**:
- 6 procedurally placed outposts with seeded random
- Min 200m between outposts, 300m from Sietch, 150m from oases
- 2-4 troopers per outpost (12-24 total)
- Octagonal patrol paths (8 waypoints at 50m radius)
- Outpost clearing (deactivates when all troopers killed)
- Deterministic placement (same seed = same positions)

**Alert System Features**:
- Troopers broadcast alerts when detecting players
- Alert radius: 300m same outpost, 500m cross-outpost
- Alert cooldown: 5 seconds per trooper
- Alert duration: 30 seconds
- Nearby troopers respond to alerts by investigating
- Troopers transition: PATROL → INVESTIGATE → PATROL or COMBAT
- Complete end-to-end alert workflow with expiration

**Planned**:
6. ⏳ Patrol Routes - Enhanced AI patrol behavior
7. ⏳ Thumper Jamming - Harkonnen can disable thumpers
8. ⏳ Loot Drops - Spice/equipment from killed Harkonnen

## Controls

### On Foot
- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **E** - Deploy thumper / Harvest spice / Enter Sietch
- **C** - Toggle debug camera
- **Enter** - Chat

### While Riding Worm

- **E** - Dismount
- **Mouse** - Look around
- Watch HUD for speed, health, water

## Next Steps

1. **VS4: PvE Combat** - Continue with Health/Combat systems (HarkonnenAI complete ✅)
2. **Client Integration** - Wire up VS3 UI and network messages
3. **Playtesting** - Validate resource loop fun factor
4. **Balance** - Tune water depletion rates and rewards

## Known Issues

- VS3 backend complete, client UI pending
- Need network message handlers for VS3 actions
- Worm may take damage from minor bumps
- Camera may clip terrain in steep areas

## Success Metrics

**Met**:
- ✅ Core worm riding loop playable
- ✅ Complete resource loop implemented
- ✅ 60fps performance
- ✅ 727 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Smooth movement
- ✅ All VS3 systems integrated
- ✅ VS4 HarkonnenAI complete (47 tests)
- ✅ VS4 CombatSystem complete (53 tests)
- ✅ VS4 Player Shooting complete (16 tests)
- ✅ VS4 Outpost System complete (40 unit + 18 integration tests)
- ✅ VS4 Alert System complete (30 unit + 11 integration tests)
- ✅ Bi-directional combat (Harkonnen ↔ Player)

**To Validate**:
- ❓ Fun factor (playtester feedback)
- ❓ 7+/10 rating for resource loop
- ❓ Balanced economy and survival

---

**Conclusion**: VS1, VS2, and VS3 fully complete on the server. VS4 PvE Combat in progress with 5/11 deliverables complete: HarkonnenAI (47 tests), CombatSystem (53 tests), Player Shooting (16 tests), Outpost System (40 tests), and Alert System (30 unit + 11 integration tests). Harkonnen troopers now spawn at 6 procedurally placed outposts with octagonal patrol paths and coordinate via alerts when detecting players. Troopers broadcast alerts (300m radius same outpost, 500m cross-outpost) that trigger nearby troopers to investigate. Ready to continue VS4 with Thumper Jamming or Loot Drops.
